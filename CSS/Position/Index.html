    <h1>This provides examples of using the CSS postion command</h1>

    <p>From this article <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101" target="_blank">question</a></p>

    <h1>Position: static</h1>
    <p>Static is the default and so will be used if you give no other option. It just stacks the boxes vertically.</p>
    <p>If you want to start shifting those elements around using offset properties such as <em>top</em>, <em>right</em>, <em>bottom</em>,
        and <em>left</em>, you’re out of luck. These properties are unavailable to a static element.</p>


    <div id="box_static_1" class="box"></div>
    <div id="box_static_2" class="box"></div>
    <div id="box_static_3" class="box"></div>

    <h1>Position: relative</h1>
    <p>We can adjust a relatively positioned element with offset properties <em>top</em>, <em>right</em>, <em>bottom</em>, and
        <em>left</em>.
        <p>In the example below I have moved the second box by adding <em>left: 200px</em> to this relative property to make
            it move right by 200px.</p>
        <p>The blue block is still in the flow of the document—elements are stacking one on top of the other—but notice the
            green block (#box_3) on the bottom. It’s sitting underneath the blue block, even though the blue block isn’t
            directly above it. When you use the offset property to shift a relatively positioned element, it doesn’t affect
            the element(s) that follow. The green box is still positioned as if the blue box were in its non-offset position.</p>
        <div id="box_relative_1" class="box"></div>
        <div id="box_relative_2" class="box"></div>
        <div id="box_relative_3" class="box"></div>
