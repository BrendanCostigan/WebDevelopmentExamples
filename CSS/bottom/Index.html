    <h1>This is an example of using the CSS postion property.</h1>
    <p>The green box and the red box have the same css except the green box is <em>relative</em> and the red box is <em>absolute</em>.
        Both have the <em>bottom</em> property set to <em>0px</em>. The green box is part on the screen as part of the screen
        flow. The red box is put at the bottom of the screen. I then tried giving <em>body</em> a large height thinking that
        would cause the <em>absolute</em> box (red box) to drop below the screen bottom</p>
